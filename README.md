# tetris-cpp-raylib
A simple tetris clone in raylib.

I have a demo video of this project in this [link](https://youtu.be/rUZsRHXKIKc)

# Technologies Used
* **C++**
* **Raylib**

# Controls
These are the keys for the game.

**Left Arrow:** Left Movement  
**Right Arrow:** Right Movement  
**Down Arrow:** Down Movement  
**Space:** Rotate Block(Clockwise)

# Running The Game
If you're using gcc(g++), open your terminal and select this directory and compile this game by executing this command in your terminal.  
`g++ -o main ./*.cpp -Iinclude -Llib -lraylib`

The command above will create a executable file named `main`. If you're using
linux like me, open your terminal and select this directory and execute this command in your terminal to run the executable:  
`./main`
